# GNN Graph Classification.
An introduction to building Graph Neural Networks using TensorFlow GNN

TensorFlow GNN is an alpha distribution of a set of tools for building graph neural networks. 
This project uses TF GNN to classify the graphs in the COLLAB dataset. COLLAB is a benchmark dataset for deep learning with graphs that
